Afterwards, imagine being:
1. on a wide river in nature with colorfull sunset; 
   - ...or on a misty river with bright sunrise; 
2. in backwater, surrounded by trees, swimming and enjoying the sun while sun is shining through;
3. on a river bank or beach, watching stars during a clear summer night.
